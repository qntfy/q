# Installers

Installers are just shell scripts for instaling something. You call them with `sudo`.

## Examples

Installing Python will install python and apply our opinions on what else is needed, like virtualenv.

```
$ sudo q/installers/python.sh
```

Installing MongoDB is basically the same

```
$ sudo q/installers/mongodb.sh
```
