# Installers

Installers are just shell scripts for instaling something. You call them with `sudo`.

## Example: Python

Installing Python will install python and apply our opinions on what else is needed, like virtualenv.

```
$ sudo q/installers/python.sh
```



This is how you install the Postgres track.

```
$ sudo boombox/tracks/postgres.sh
```
